PIR motion activated RGB stair LED strip for Arduino.

The goal of this project is to have animated RGB WS2812B stair lights underneath a handrail. The LED strip turns on when motion is detected at the top or the bottom of the stairs by PIR motion sensors.

This requires the FastLED library - https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

Components:
* WS2812B LED strip
* PIR motion sensors (x2)
* 1000uF capacitor
* 5v 10a power supply
